Well the first month of the 2016 is in the can, and in a flash we have reached 4 issues of the Land and Expand newsletter. 

As outlined in the [launch post][0], you will know this is very much an experiment. A simple idea:  If you follow, or are involved in, the London Tech scene then you are probably spending a lot of time trying to drink from the news firehose to stay up to date - I know I am. 

Simply this exists to save you time, by delivering a hand crafted digest of the most interesting London Tech stories we have enjoyed during the week. Nothing more, nothing less.

So 4 weeks in what have we learnt?

Well first off there is certainly no shortage of news. I've been surprised by how many editorial decisions we have had to make in terms of what to leave out to keep the weekly story list short and punchy.

London is vibrant. There have been numerous fund raising stories and exits from London start ups already this year, and we are just 1 month in. We have also covered the publication of some essential reading. In issue 1 we had the [Tech Nation 200 Almanac][1], and in issue 4 the [European Tech Exits 2015 Report][2] from Tech.eu

Politics and London Tech go hand in hand it seems. Already we have had a couple of stories on the London Mayoral process, the UK's tax deal with Google, regulation of Uber, and the restructuring of the US-EU Safe Harbor agreement.

Wow - a short pause for breath - now we look forward to February and everything that has in store. 

If this is useful, please share with friends and colleagues. Also let us know what you think. Ping us any suggestions on how to improve, or what to cover.

Till next time.
